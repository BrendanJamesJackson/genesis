<h2 class="chapter">1 Description</h2>

<h3 class="section">1.1 Introduction</h3>

<p class="noindent">This manual describes <code>Genesis</code>, a program created for scientists
to generate PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and structure/admixture
graphs from data outputted by common tools such as eigenstrat [Pritchard
et al. 2000] and the SNPRelate [Zheng et al 2012] package for PCAs and
Admixture [Alexander et al. 2009] and CLUMPP [Jakobsson and Rosenberg
2007] for admixtures.

   <p>Genesis was developed with user-friendliness in mind as other tools can
be complex to use and lack certain features. All elements of the graphs
that would need to be edited can be done so using a graphical user
Interface where the graphs themselves are interactive and different
elements can be viewed and changed at the click of the mouse. All this
saves the time that scientists would rather be spending doing more
important things.

   <p>Principal Component Analysis is a mathematical and statistical procedure
that can used to analyse genotype data. The differences between samples'
genotype data can be used to project each sample into a
<em>p</em>-dimensional space, where the <em>p</em> axes are
uncorrelated. For realistic data, typically <em>p</em> is 4 or less and
often only the most important two demsnions are used. Programs such as
<code>eigenstrat</code> produce the the PCs, and <code>Genesis</code> produces
them. An example is found below:

   <p>Admixture mappings are used to analyse populations of mixed ancestry and
determine the ratios of proposed different ancestries. These ratios can
then displayed in stacked bar graphs as structure/admixture graphs.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Assumptions</h3>

<p>This manual assumes that the reader is familiar with structure and PCA
analysis of genotype data, and has used tools such as admixture,
Eigenstrat and/or plink [Purcell et al 2007; Purcell and Chang 2014].
